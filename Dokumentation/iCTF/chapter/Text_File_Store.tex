\chapter{Text\_File\_Store}
If you open the site you can see a form where you can login with a username and password or you can enter a short message you want to store.
After storing some text you get the username and the password to look for that text later. The username and the password are calculated at runtime of the service. 

Every parameter of the service are passed in the URL via GET. In the viewFile.php file you can find a parameter called "file". This parameter is used to access a file in the directory where all textfiles are stored. 

But if you modify this parameter you can read the content of the access.log file without any verification. 
In this file you can see every connection to this service. At last you have to filter for the flags and read them. 
Also it is possible to inject a command with an adjusted url call. It generates a file on the server with the filenames in the service-directory. With this information it is possible to open the files containing the flags.
