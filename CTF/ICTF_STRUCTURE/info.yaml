type: console
description: This service offers two functions. The first is a tool to check if your Folkswagen car has issues with its emmission values, by entering a frame number. How Folkswagenframenumbers have to be formed can be found on http://www.nininet.de/fahrgestellnummer.html. Here is an example WVWZZZ1JZXW000001. Since Folkswagen is a bavarian company, this service is in bavarian, a german dialect. But we offer a translator that translates bavarian words to german though it might not be that helpful.
flag_id_description: The first 6 caracters of the flag id are the first 6 caracters of a car frame number, the following 4 caracters are the first 4 caracters of a word from the translator.
